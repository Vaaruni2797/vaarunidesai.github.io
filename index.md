Welcome! I am Vaaruni Desai. 

I am an AI researcher obsessed with how transformers think.
I specialize in building probing tools to align AI to human goals.

Past work include: 

[### **FinetuningForFlashcards**](https://github.com/Vaaruni2797/FinetuningForFlashcards)
AI-powered flashcard generator using fine‑tuned transformers.

[### **pickucot**](https://github.com/Vaaruni2797/pickucot)
Framework for probing causal hint use and explanation faithfulness.

[### **Attention‑MLPs‑in‑Transformer‑XOR**](https://github.com/Vaaruni2797/Attention-MLPs-in-Transformer-XOR)
Experiments analyzing grokking, attention entropy, and representation phase transitions.
