Welcome! I am Vaaruni Desai. 

I’m an AI researcher specializing in interpretability, alignment and transformer training dynamics.

I build and analyze probing pipelines that quantify how syntactic structure emerges across model layers and training checkpoints. My work includes attention entropy studies, PCA-based representation dynamics, and longitudinal experiments that track how reasoning circuits evolve.
Ask me about it!

Before getting into research, I engineered secure and high‑performance REST APIs at Refinitiv (LSEG) and Thomson Reuters.

I hold a Master’s in Data Science & Engineering from UC San Diego.
